# Udemy Creation Date - Chrome Extension

Knowing how fast tech changes, Udemy realized that the demand for *ultra mega* updated courses was rapidly making their instructor's courses obsolete.
Udemy decided to prevent the user from seeing the creation date of the courses, and started to persuade users with a last update date, which is changed 
however small the update is (e.g. renaming a class or a description).

This extension brings back the ability to see the creation date inside any Udemy's courses pages.
The extension fetches Udemy's Affiliate API to get the courses creation date, and return it as a component within the courses pages.

**Hovering the component also shows the real age of the courses in years, months, and days.**
